# STATUS.md — Build State & Gate Sign-offs

**Book:** AI1 CLI
**Current phase:** 0 — BLUEPRINT
**Last updated:** (set on each change)

The agent reads this file before every phase. A phase may begin only when the
**previous** phase's gate below is checked **and** initialed by a human (or, for
non-human-only gates, confirmed by the agent with evidence linked).

> Marking a gate: replace `[ ]` with `[x]`, add who signed and the date, and link
> the evidence (a file path, a command's output, a commit). GATE 3 must be signed
> by a human.
